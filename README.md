# DOMParser

The main goal of this project is to build a DOM-like tree from an HTML file. There will be multiple iterations.

## 1st Iteration
1. Read HTML line by line, then iterate over each character to build a stack.
2. From the stack to a tree, using conditions to determine each node and next node relationship.
